#Demo Git REpository

This is the first file in this repo.

##Ipsum Below
So, let's continue on making modifications to our README file
within our "git-demo" repository. So, again. I'll verify where I'm at; so "pwd"
shows that I'm in our "git-demo" repository folder. And, if I do a "git status",
you can see that I have a clean working directory. 

"Adding more ipsum". And, it just added and committed in one step;
and so now, if I do a "git status", you can see I'm back to a clean working directory.
